# ðŸ¤– What is the LIMO COBOT Project?

<Admonition type="info" title="Mission Statement">
<strong>
To build a modular, real-world-ready mobile manipulator that can autonomously explore, detect, pick, and deliver objectsâ€”using only open-source tools, affordable hardware, and robust ROS2 code.
</strong>
</Admonition>

The **LIMO COBOT Project** brings together a LIMO Pro robot, a MyCobot arm, and state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detectionâ€”creating a powerful, flexible robot capable of autonomous navigation, intelligent object manipulation, and seamless integration with modern research or industrial workflows.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Goals

- Make advanced robotics accessible to everyone (students, researchers, devs)
- Combine **navigation, perception, and manipulation** into a single working system
- Provide a full, _battle-tested_ workflow from **hardware setup to autonomous missions**
- Document every step (and mistake!) so you succeed faster than we did

<Admonition type="tip" title="What makes it unique?">
- **Voice feedback** at every stage
- One-command launch and automated IP detection for the arm
- Handles _real-world messiness_: network drops, hardware fails, bad mapsâ€”_and recovers_
- All code and docs are open for learning, reuse, and hacking
</Admonition>

## ðŸ¤© What can you do with it?

- Deploy as a testbed for **AI & robotics research**
- Automate pick-and-place tasks in labs, classrooms, or demos
- Build on top: add web UI, new detection models, more arms, or advanced behaviors
