<Admonition type="info" title="This documentation is for you if...">
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>You're a student or researcher</strong> looking to build, customize, or deeply understand a real-world mobile manipulation robot with ROS2.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You're a developer</strong> interested in production-grade robotics software—object detection, navigation, and robot arms—using Python and open-source hardware.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You're a hobbyist or educator</strong> who wants step-by-step guidance (with all the “gotchas” called out!) to make things work _in real life_, not just in simulation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>You value clear, honest, and complete documentation</strong>—including mistakes, lessons learned, and practical fixes.
  </li>
</ul>
