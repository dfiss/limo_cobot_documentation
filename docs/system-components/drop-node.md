# ðŸ“¦ Drop Node

The **Drop Node** is responsible for releasing the object at a designated location (drop zone) with precision and safety.  
It works closely with the **Mission Manager** to complete the final stage of an object-handling task.

---

## ðŸ”„ Drop Operation Workflow

1. **Receive trigger** from Mission Manager (`/drop_trigger` or action call).
2. Navigate robot to **drop zone coordinates** (predefined or dynamic).
3. Move arm to **pre-drop pose** (safe above drop location).
4. Open gripper to release object.
5. Move arm back to **home position**.
6. Confirm drop completion to Mission Manager.

## ðŸŽ¯ Positioning & Accuracy

- **Base Pose:**  
  The robot returns to a fixed base pose before dropping. This ensures consistent accuracy by aligning the arm with the drop zone.

- **Pose Calibration:**  
  - Align the armâ€™s coordinate frame with the robotâ€™s base_link.
  - Use measured offsets to ensure the gripper is centered over the drop area.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  Always perform a one-time calibration for the drop pose after hardware changes.

## ðŸ›¡ Safety Mechanisms

| Safety Feature         | Purpose                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Pre-drop safe height   | Prevents collisions during approach         |
| Collision limits       | Stops arm if unexpected resistance is felt  |
| Timed gripper control  | Avoids overdriving servo motors             |
| Home position reset    | Ensures arm is safely stowed after drop     |

## ðŸ§ª Testing Procedures

**Step-by-step:**
1. **Dry Run:**  
   Run drop sequence without holding an object â€” verify arm paths.
2. **Low-Speed Test:**  
   Hold a lightweight object and run the sequence slowly.
3. **Load Test:**  
   Drop real objects at operational speed.
4. **Repeatability Test:**  
   Drop 10+ times and measure deviation from target.

**Pass Criteria:**
- Drop point within Â±2 cm of target.
- Arm returns to home position safely.
- No collisions or grip failures.

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimization

- **Reduce approach time:**  
  Move arm in a single smooth motion from transport pose to pre-drop pose.
- **Use fixed drop offsets:**  
  Avoid re-calculating positions each time.
- **Tune joint speeds:**  
  Increase joint velocity for faster cycles (while staying safe).
- **Parallelize:**  
  Prepare next navigation goal while arm returns to home.

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

| Issue                         | Possible Cause                           | Solution |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Object misses drop area        | Incorrect calibration or offsets          | Recalibrate drop pose |
| Arm collides with environment  | Pre-drop height too low                   | Increase Z offset |
| Gripper fails to open          | Servo issue or wrong topic/service name   | Test gripper manually |
| Arm stuck after drop           | Missing return-to-home command            | Add home pose command |
