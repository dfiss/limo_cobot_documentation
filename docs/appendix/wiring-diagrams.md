## üõ† Assembly Instructions

1. **Mount the MyCobot**  
   - Secure the arm base to the LIMO mounting plate using M4 screws.  
   - Ensure no cable interference during arm motion.

2. **Connect the Orbbec Camera**  
   - Mount securely at the front of the LIMO base.  
   - Run the USB 3.0 cable along the chassis, avoiding wheel areas.

3. **Power the Onboard Computer**  
   - Connect DC barrel jack to power source.  
   - If using the LIMO‚Äôs 24V port, ensure proper voltage regulation.

4. **Setup MyCobot Wi-Fi**  
   - Power on the arm.  
   - Connect to hotspot `MyCobotWiFi2.4G` (pass: `mycobot123`).  
   - The `full_system.launch.py` script will auto-detect IP.

5. **Final Safety Check**  
   - Test E-stop function.  
   - Verify no loose or pinched cables.
