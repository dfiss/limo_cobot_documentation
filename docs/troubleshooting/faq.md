## ‚ö° Quick Answers

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="object-detection" label="Object Detection">

**Q:** YOLO is not detecting objects ‚Äî what should I check?  
**A:**  
- Confirm camera topics are active:  
  ```bash
  ros2 topic list | grep camera
  ```
- Check YOLO weights path in `object_detector.py` matches your trained model.
- Ensure lighting is adequate and the object is within depth sensor range.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="navigation" label="Navigation Issues">

**Q:** Robot spins in place or doesn't move to goal.  
**A:**
- Make sure `pose_setter` published the initial pose (check logs).
- Verify `nav2_params.yaml` matches your map.
- Reset AMCL and re-run navigation:
  ```bash
  ros2 lifecycle set /amcl configure
  ros2 lifecycle set /amcl activate
  ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="arm" label="Arm Control">

**Q:** MyCobot is not responding.  
**A:**
- Ensure Wi-Fi is connected to:
  ```
  SSID: MyCobotWiFi2.4G
  PASS: mycobot123
  ```
- Run IP detection logic from `full_system.launch.py` to confirm the arm is found.
- Power cycle the arm if connection fails.

## üí° Common Problems & Solutions

| Problem | Possible Cause | Quick Fix |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Nav2 server not ready | Launch order issue | Increase delay in `full_system.launch.py` TimerAction |
| Pick/Drop timeout | Arm motion blocked or Wi-Fi lag | Clear workspace, re-run arm node with stable signal |
| Map drift | Poor AMCL initialization | Re-publish `/initialpose` from `pose_setter.py` |
| YOLO lag | Low GPU/CPU resources | Lower image resolution or increase confidence threshold |
