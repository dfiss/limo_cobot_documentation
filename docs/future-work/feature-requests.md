## ‚öñÔ∏è Evaluation Criteria

When deciding whether to implement a feature, we consider:

- **Impact** ‚Äî Will it significantly improve workflow or capabilities?
- **Feasibility** ‚Äî Can it be implemented with available hardware and time?
- **Performance Cost** ‚Äî Will it slow down detection, navigation, or arm control?
- **Safety** ‚Äî Does it introduce any risk to the robot, objects, or users?
- **Maintainability** ‚Äî Can it be supported long-term without major rework?

## üè∑ Implementation Priorities

| Priority | Definition | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **High** | Critical for performance, reliability, or safety | Health diagnostics node |
| **Medium** | Improves usability or flexibility | Voice command support |
| **Low** | Nice-to-have but non-essential | Fun voice feedback variations |
