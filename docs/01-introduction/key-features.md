# ✨ Key Features and Capabilities

Meet the reasons why **LIMO Cobot** stands out from the crowd.

## 🚦 End-to-End Autonomy

- **Self-driving navigation** with precision, using robust mapping and localization (SLAM, Nav2).
- **Automatic waypoint scanning** for full-room coverage—no corner left unexplored.

## 🎯 Advanced Object Detection

- **YOLOv8-powered 3D perception**—detects, localizes, and classifies objects in real-time.
- **Custom model support:** train your own datasets and deploy instantly.
- **Smart approach logic**—robot always stops at a safe distance for manipulation.

## 🦾 Mobile Manipulation

- **MyCobot 6-DOF arm integration:** precise pick and place, with open/close gripper.
- **Wireless (WLAN) arm control:** no more cable tangles or USB failures!
- **Configurable pick & drop poses:** adapt to new objects and tasks.

## 🗣️ Natural User Feedback

- **Voice announcements** at every stage: navigation, detection, pick, drop, and errors.
- **Visual feedback** via Rviz, RQt Image View, and LED indicators (where supported).

## ⚡️ Easy Bringup & Automation

- **One-command launch** (via custom launch scripts with automated IP discovery).
- **Timed initialization:** all nodes start in correct sequence, every time.
- **Hotspot and auto-IP:** just connect MyCobot WiFi—no manual IP entry needed.

## 🧰 Robust & Production-Ready

- **Failsafe logic**—handles timeouts, navigation failures, and hardware errors.
- **Battle-tested on real hardware:** not just theory or simulation.
- **Completely open source**—customize and hack every layer.
